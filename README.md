# Apache Pekko Connectors samples

Samples for [Apache Pekko Connectors](https://pekko.apache.org/docs/pekko-connectors/current/).

The samples should run with Java 8 or above. If you are building the docs using [Paradox](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/paradox/current/index.html)
then you will need to use Java 11.

## Status

The samples now use Pekko libs instead of Akka/Alpakka. If you find any issues, please raise an issue or a Pull Request.

There is still some work to do on the docs but the snapshot docs should be usable. See https://nightlies.apache.org/pekko/docs/pekko-connectors-samples/main-snapshot/docs/
